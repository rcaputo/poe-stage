POE::Stage::Resolver - a simple non-blocking DNS resolver

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# Note, this is not a complete program.
	# See the distribution's examples directory.

	sub some_handler :Handler {
		my $req_resolver = POE::Stage::Resolver->new(
			method      => "resolve",
			on_success  => "handle_host",
			on_error    => "handle_error",
			args        => {
				input     => "thirdlobe.com",
				type      => "A",   # A is default
				class     => "IN",  # IN is default
			},
		);
	}

	sub handle_host :Handler {
		my ($arg_input, $arg_packet);

		my @answers = $arg_packet->answer();
		foreach my $answer (@answers) {
			print(
				"Resolved: $arg_input = type(", $answer->type(), ") data(",
				$answer->rdatastr, ")\n"
			);
		}

		# Cancel the resolver by destroying it.
		my $req_resolver = undef;
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Stage::Resolver is a simple non-blocking DNS resolver.  For now
it uses Net::DNS::Resolver for the bulk of its work.  It returns
Net::DNS::Packet objects in its "success" responses.  Please see the
documentation for Net::DNS.

package POE::Stage::Resolver;

use POE::Stage qw(:base self req);
use POE::Watcher::Delay;
use Net::DNS::Resolver;
use POE::Watcher::Input;
use Carp qw(croak);

=head1 PUBLIC COMMANDS

Commands are invoked with POE::Request objects.

=head2 new (input => INPUT, type => TYPE, class => CLASS)

Creates a POE::Stage::Resolver instance and asks it to resolve some
INPUT into records of a given CLASS and TYPE.  CLASS and TYPE default
to "IN" and "A", respectively.

When complete, the stage will respond with either a "success" or an
"error" message.

=head1 PUBLIC RESPONSES

Responses are returned by POE::Request->return() or emit().

=head2 "success" (input, packet)

Net::DNS::Resolver successfully resolved a request.  The original
input is passed back in the "input" parameter.  The resulting
Net::DNS::Packet object is returned in "packet".

=head2 "error" (input, error)

Net::DNS::Resolver, or something else, failed to resolve the input to
a response.  The original input is passed back in the "input"
parameter.  Net::DNS::Resolver's error message comes back as "error".

=head1 BUGS

See L<http://thirdlobe.com/projects/poe-stage/report/1> for known
issues.  See L<http://thirdlobe.com/projects/poe-stage/newticket> to
report one.


POE::Stage is too young for production use.  For example, its syntax
is still changing.  You probably know what you don't like, or what you
need that isn't included, so consider fixing or adding that, or at
least discussing it with the people on POE's mailing list or IRC
channel.  Your feedback and contributions will bring POE::Stage closer
to usability.  We appreciate it.
