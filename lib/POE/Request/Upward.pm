=head1 NAME

POE::Request::Upward - internal base class for POE::Stage response messages

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	This module isn't meant to be used directly.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Stage messages are generally asynchronous, which means that
multiple "calls" can be in play at once.  To track them, POE::Stage
uses a call tree rather than a call stack.

POE::Request::Upward is a base class for POE::Request messages that
flow up from sub-stages (closer to leaf nodes) to their parents
(closer to the root node).  Both POE::Request::Emit and
POE::Request::Returns are subclasses of POE::Request::Upward.

The Emit and Return message classes share a lot of common code.  That
code has been hoisted into this base class.

Upward messages are automatically created and dispatched as a side
effect of calling POE::Request's emit() and return() methods.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

These methods are called directly on the class or object.

=head2 new ARGUMENT_PAIRS

POE::Request::Upward's new() constructor is almost always called
internally by POE::Request->emit() or POE::Request->return().  Most
parameters to emit() and return() are passed directly to this
constructor.

POE::Request::Upward has one mandatory parameter: "type".  This
defines the type of response being created.  If specified, the
optional "args" parameter must contain a hashref with response
payloads.  The contents of "args" are passed unchanged to the
response's handler as lexicals with names prefixed by "arg_".

Response types are mapped to methods in the original requester's stage
through POE::Request's "on_$type" parameters.  In this example,
responses of type "success" are mapped to the requester's
continue_on() method.  Likewise "error" responses are mapped to the
requester's log_and_stop() method.

	my $req_connect = POE::Request->new(
		stage       => $tcp_client,
		method      => "connect",
		on_success  => "continue_on",
		on_error    => "log_and_stop",
	);

How an asynchronous TCP connector might return success and error
messages (although we're not sure yet):

	my $req;
	$req->return(
		type      => "success",
		args      => {
			socket  => $socket,
		},
	);

	$req->return(
		type        => "error",
		args        => {
			function  => "connect",
			errno     => $!+0,
			errstr    => "$!",
		},
	);

Optionally, POE::Request objects may contain roles.  Responses come
back as "on_${role}_${type}" messages.  For example, one stage might
call another (a socket "factory") to create a TCP client socket.  In
this example, the call's role is "connect", and the two previous
return() calls are used to return a socket on success or error info on
failure:

	my $req_connect = POE::Request->new(
		stage       => $tcp_client,
		method      => "connect",
		role        => "connect",
	);

If the factor returns "success", the on_connect_success() method will
be called upon to handle it:

	sub on_connect_success {
		my $arg_socket;  # contains the "socket" argument
	}

Likewise, on_connect_failure() will be called if the connection
failed:

	sub on_connect_failure {
		my ($arg_function, $arg_errno, $arg_errstr);
	}

=head1 BUGS

See L<http://thirdlobe.com/projects/poe-stage/report/1> for known
issues.  See L<http://thirdlobe.com/projects/poe-stage/newticket> to
report one.

POE::Stage is too young for production use.  For example, its syntax
is still changing.  You probably know what you don't like, or what you
need that isn't included, so consider fixing or adding that, or at
least discussing it with the people on POE's mailing list or IRC
channel.  Your feedback and contributions will bring POE::Stage closer
to usability.  We appreciate it.

=head1 SEE ALSO

POE::Request::Upward has two subclasses: L<POE::Request::Emit> for
emitting multiple responses to a single request, and
L<POE::Request::Return> for sending a final response to end a request.

POE::Request::Upward inherits from L<POE::Request>.
