=head1 NAME

POE::Watcher::Delay - wait for a length of time to pass

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# Note, this is not a complete program.
	# See the distribution's examples directory.

	# Request a delay notification.
	my $watcher :Req = POE::Watcher::Delay->new(
		seconds     => 10,            # wait 10 seconds, then
		on_success  => "time_is_up",  # call $self->time_is_up()
		args        => {
			param_1   => 123,           # with $args->{param_1}
			param_2   => "abc",         # and $args->{param_2}
		},
	);

	# Handle the delay notification.
	sub time_is_up {
		my ($self, $args) = @_;
		print "$args->{param_1}\n";   # 123
		print "$args->{param_2}\n";   # abc
		my $watcher :Req = undef;     # Destroy the watcher.
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A POE::Watcher::Delay object waits a certain amount of time before
invoking a method on the current Stage object.  Both the time to wait
and the method to invoke are given as constructor parameters.
Parameters included in the C<args> hash are passed unchanged to the
desired callback method after the specified time has elapsed.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

These methods are invoked directly on the watcher object.

=head2 new seconds => SECONDS, on_success => METHOD_NAME

Construct a new POE::Watcher::Delay object.  The constructor takes two
parameters: "seconds" is the number of seconds to wait.  "on_success"
is the name of the mothod in the current Stage to invoke when length
seconds have elapsed.

Like every other watcher object, this one must be saved in order to
remain active.  Destroy this object to cancel it.
