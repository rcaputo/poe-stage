For the BUGS section:

POE::Stage is too young for production use.  For example, its syntax
is still changing.  You probably know what you don't like, or what you
need that isn't included, so consider fixing or adding that, or at
least discussing it with the people on POE's mailing list or IRC
channel.  Your feedback and contributions will bring POE::Stage closer
to usability.  We appreciate it.
