=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 new wheel_class => NAME, wheel_parameters => HASHREF

Create a new POE::Watcher::Wheel, encapsulating a CLASS_NAME type of
wheel object.  The wheel is constructed using WHEEL_PARAMS, which are
for the most part passed directly to the wheel's constructor.

The CLASS_NAME wheel should be loaded ahead of time.

Since POE::Watcher classes invoke callbacks rather than emit events,
use /.*Method$/ parameters wherever you would normally use /.*Event$/
parameters in the Wheel constructor.  The SYNOPSIS might shed some
light on this if it were complete.

Destroy this object to cancel it.

=head1 BUGS

See L<http://thirdlobe.com/projects/poe-stage/report/1> for known
issues.  See L<http://thirdlobe.com/projects/poe-stage/newticket> to
report one.

POE::Stage is too young for production use.  For example, its syntax
is still changing.  You probably know what you don't like, or what you
need that isn't included, so consider fixing or adding that.  It'll
bring POE::Stage that much closer to a usable release.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<POE::Watcher> describes concepts that are common to all POE::Watcher
classes.  It's required reading in order to understand fully what's
going on.
