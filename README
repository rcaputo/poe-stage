POE::Stage is a temporary, experimental project to formalize POE
components and provide a base class to make their creation and use a
lot easier and cleaner.  The project's Subversion repository is hosted
at https://thirdlobe.com/svn/poe-stage/trunk/ .

Please poke around in the code.  Think about how it may help or hinder
your development efforts.  Let me know what I'm doing right.  Explain
the errors of my ways when I get something wrong.  Request features.
Send patches.

The project's name may change in the near future, but your guess is as
good as mine what it will become.  Maybe your guess is better.  Send
in your spiffy suggestions.

Thanks for your interest.
