Do we even need an App class for self-contained subclass
components?  Nifty!  Try to avoid it.

# Creating the server object will also set it up.
# init() fires the event, self-firing style.
# We need callbacks that redirect to other stages.

Uppercase parameters are constructor arguments?  Does it matter which
are for the constructor?
