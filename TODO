The recent massive commit includes duplicated and sometimes crude and
ugly code because it was hard to align all the fiddly little bits so
they would work.

Now that they do:

1. Abstract common bits from the various watchers and requests into
base classes.

2. Document what exists so far.

3. Create a POE::Stage::Resolver that is analogous to
POE::Component::Client::DNS

	a. Add any new watchers we'll need.

4. Create a POE::Stage::KeepaliveClient that is analogous to
POE::Component::Client::Keepalive.

	a. Add any new watchers we'll need.

5. Create a POE::Stage::HttpClient that is analogous to
POE::Component::Client::HTTP

	a. Add any new watchers we'll need.
